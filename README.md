Code and other stuffs for my Parallel and Distributed Computing

## Liability and Honor Code ##
I am NOT responsible for your grade or any Honor Code Violation. I only
place my code on GitHub so I can sync between computers and use version
control. This repository was kept private until final grades were released
to prevent violations and cheating, but was then publicized to display my coding
abilities for job interviews, employers, and related such. Use at your own risk.
