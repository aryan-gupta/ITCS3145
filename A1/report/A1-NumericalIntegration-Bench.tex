	\section{A1-NumericalIntegration-code}
	The assignment was to run our integration code on the mamba server. This would allow us to run long term tasks on a mulithreaded enviroment. The proceedure was simple. The code was pushed to the mamba server, then compiled and submitted in the job queue. One of the issues I can into was that I accideentally wrote a loop with a float as the counter variable and it broke with large numbers. After the code was fixed, I resubmited the job and it worked like a charm.
